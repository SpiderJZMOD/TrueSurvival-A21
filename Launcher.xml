			<Description>Mod is not finished and is still in active development and open to suggestions, feed back and bug reports. At this time no assets may be used for redistribution.
            
			Unfortunately because of the severity and the amount of bugs in the current vanilla build this mod will not function correctly on Servers or in Coop until TFP fix the bugs.
			
            This mod was designed to walk the line between realism and fun engaging gameplay. Where realism became grindy or not fun I tried to aim for engaging gameplay mechanics with a focus on risk and reward and a strong sense of consequences. Death in this mod is permanent with few exceptions. In this mod when death occurs your player data is wiped and you will respawn as a fresh new player.
